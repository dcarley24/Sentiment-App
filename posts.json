This week, I was awarded Solutions Engineer of the Year at Vimeo's SKO, and I couldn\u2019t be prouder.\r\n\r\nNot because I won SE of the Year\u2014though I admit I feel surprisingly proud of that\u2014but because I made the right choice for me: leaving the C-Suite (and many toxic colleagues) behind and going back to being \u201cjust\u201d an SE.\r\n\r\nI made the decision because being a Solutions Engineer was the most fun I ever had working, and I couldn\u2019t see any reason I wouldn\u2019t do that again.\r\n\r\nSince then, my mental health, my marriage, my dog frisbee skills, my cooking, and pretty much every other facet of my life have improved infinitely compared to when I was an executive. I can confidently say the last several years have been some of the happiest of my adult life. \r\n\r\nWhat surprised me when I made the switch was how many SE hiring managers weren\u2019t interested in someone whose previous job titles were COO and CSO.\r\nEric Brown took a chance on me\u2014despite advice from some of his colleagues, who shared the same reservations others had: \u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t really want to be an SE,\u201d they all said. But he sensed I was genuine and gave me a shot. \r\nEric: Thank you.\r\n\r\nWhile our time together at Qumu was brief (what a dumpster fire that place was), I was fortunate to join him again when he moved to Vimeo. Alongside my AE partner of six years, Joe Safken (AE of the Year himself, by the way!), we\u2019ve been on a roll. Thinking back, the last few years have been some of the most enjoyable of my 20+ years in the industry.\r\n[Shout-out to the Limelight Networks SE team circa 2007, which became the touchstone I reflected on during my sabbatical and inspired me to return to this role\u2014those were good times!]\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t post on LinkedIn often. I\u2019m not interested in being an influencer or thought leader or any of that jazz, but I wanted to share this because I know many people can\u2019t fathom leaving fancy titles and higher salaries for a \u201clesser\u201d role, even if it would bring them more fun and fulfillment.\r\nIf that sounds like you, I urge you to reflect on what matters most in life.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a Solutions Engineer because I\u2019m both good at it and I LOVE doing it. And it\u2019s the best thing I can do for myself.\r\nYep, I\u2019m proud of that.",

On the good side I actually made a very nice living doing something I truly love\u2014while not missing a single important moment of my personal life. But on the not so good side, being fractional is an expensive and risky career choice that is getting more competitive by the day. Fortunately I've never minded a little risk or a little competition, so I think I'll stick it out for awhile longer.",

Instead of thinking about 9,979,001 things I could be doing\u2026 \r\n\r\nI focus on 1 that can push the business forward the most. Then, I do that. \r\n\r\n(h/t Gary Keller)\r\n\r\n2.

He takes her on dates, to ballgames, out to eat\u2026 not to a club or partying on the weekends.\r\n\r\nI see my daughter dating a boy who takes her to church with him.

I just wanted to take a quick moment to set the record straight because some folks have asked me about it.\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks ago, I suddenly lost much of the vision in my right eye. Thinking it was a bad case of eye strain, I went to the ophthalmologist. It was there that the doctor looked in my eye and told me that it appeared that I had suffered a hemorrhage. I was sent to a retinal specialist who diagnosed Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion -- basically, there is fluid leaking into my retina. The result is severely distorted vision.\r\n\r\nI'm on a treatment plan for the next year (I'll spare you the details in deference to those of you who may have just eaten lunch). The patch is partly to rest my eye and partly on account of not wanting to gross people out. Long-term prognosis for getting my vision back is iffy -- but without treatment things would most likely get a lot worse. So, treatment it is.\r\n\r\nI don't usually share health related things, but this one is so obvious and public that I wanted to get out in front of it. My job is obviously nothing but a sea of calm and bliss everyday, but if you happen to be in a stressful job and do a lot of screen time, pay attention to the effect on your eyes. Eat healthily, try to relax, and keep those peepers working properly.",

Every remote day needed permission. Every promotion went to whoever played politics best. I was basically asking for permission to live my own life.\r\n\r\nThen I took a trip to Colombia.\r\n\r\nMet some guys running online businesses... making $800/month freelancing. They were broke as a joke.\r\n\r\nYet, THEY, not ME, were living life on their terms.\r\n\r\nThey were 10x happier than me in my golden handcuffs.\r\n\r\nDecember 2015:\r\n\r\nCalled my parents: \"I'm quitting my job to go all-in on my anonymous dating blog.\"\r\n\r\nThey thought I was having a quarter-life crisis.\r\n\r\nMaybe I was.\r\n\r\nBut here's the truth about entrepreneurship that nobody tells you:\r\nThe regret of not trying will haunt you more than any failure ever could.\r\nI made myself one rule: Publish something EVERY single day for a year. Blog post, video, or podcast.\r\n\r\nIf I couldn't make it work after a year of pure hustle, I didn't deserve to make it.\r\n\r\nThen something crazy happened:\r\n\r\n\u2022 The blog started making money\r\n\u2022 Built some niche SEO websites\r\n\u2022 Launched an olive oil company\r\n\u2022 Started a recruiting firm\r\n\u2022 Bought property, got married\r\n\r\nEach win stacked on the next.\r\n\r\nFast forward to 2025: Living life completely on my terms.\r\n\r\nBut it's not all sunshine and rainbows.\r\n\r\nLost my mom to cancer in 2023, aged 58. Life is short. Tomorrow isn't guaranteed. This is why waiting till 65 to \"live your life\" is just...not the way.\r\n\r\nHere's what they don't tell you about the entrepreneurial journey:\r\n\r\nIt never gets easier to ride a bike up a mountain. You just get faster. Today's mountains become tomorrow's speed bumps. If you love your 9-5, keep crushing it. Companies need good people.\r\n\r\nBut if you've got that itch... \r\n\r\nThat voice saying \"there's more\"...\r\n \r\nThat feeling you're meant for more...\r\n\r\nYou owe it to yourself to scratch it.\r\n\r\nBecause one day you'll be on your deathbed...and \"what if\" is the most painful question you can ask yourself.\r\n\r\nMost people will read this, feel something stir inside them, and do absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nThey'll go back to their cushy job tomorrow. Back to asking permission for vacation. Back to trading their life for a pension.\r\n\r\nDon't be most people.\r\n\r\nYour future self will thank you.",

It wasn't all sweet, nor was it bitter. It was just suited for me at the time. \r\nI then imagine if this is how the big influencers in the social media space feel\u2014the point where your words almost seem like a verdict.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting to me how that not-so-little decision I made to apply to Association of Resident Doctors, UNIOSUN Teaching Hospital Osogbo. (ARD-UTH) has become a road map for others.\r\n\r\nIronically, when I made the decision to stay at the hospital regardless, it was the lowest paying hospital in the South West.\r\nEvery salary we got felt like an insult, especially when we compared it to other hospitals we knew and heard of.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, the money is quite important. Infact, very important, but there are things (instructions in my case) that far outweigh money.\r\n\r\n\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc1f \ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc32, \ud835\udc21\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30 \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc21 \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc07\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc32\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e? (Selah)\r\n\r\nIt's a year after, and that very uncommon choice is becoming a major consideration for people I have slowly but surely influenced by sticking with a personal growth and display excellence even when there is allowance for mediocrity.\r\n\r\nThe growth, influence, worthy connections, knowledge and insight I have received for my journey by obeying the prompt to apply only to Uniosun Teaching Hospital, has brought me far greater blessings than I can share and could ever remember to number.\r\n\r\nI'm reminded that my life is a testament to what God can do with yieldedness.\r\n\r\nHappy weekends.",

She was feeling lost, unsure of her next step, and frustrated by her financial situation. But as we talked, she casually mentioned her love for cooking\u2014how she created unique recipes and how much people loved her meals.\r\n\r\nI stopped her right there. \"Do you realize you\u2019re sitting on a business?\"\r\n\r\nShe had a gift, but like so many women\u2014especially immigrant women\u2014she didn\u2019t see it as valuable enough to build a business around. We\u2019re taught to look for \u201ctraditional\u201d jobs, not to trust what comes naturally to us.\r\n\r\nI walked her through how she could turn her passion into a profitable side hustle. She started small with catering. Then, as she gained confidence, she expanded into meal prep services. Now? She\u2019s hosting cooking classes and working on her first cookbook.\r\n\r\nThis is the power of monetizing your skills.\r\n\r\n\u27a1\ufe0f Your skills are your currency. If you can teach it, create it, or solve a problem with it\u2014you can sell it.\r\n\u27a1\ufe0f Digital business is scalable. From online classes to e-books and coaching, you can earn without trading time for money.\r\n\u27a1\ufe0f God gave you gifts for a reason. Proverbs 18:16 says, \"A man's gift makes room for him and brings him before great men.\" Your talents are meant to open doors.",
